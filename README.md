# README

This is a simple blog of mine built using Blogdown, 
an R package utilizing the Hugo static site generator engine. 
The current address of this blog is [ahmad-alkadri.github.io](https://ahmad-alkadri.github.io). 
Sometimes I blog about my learning of ML and DL techniques, 
coding in R, and statistical analysis. Mostly I'll blog about 
books that I read, works that I'm currently doing, and 
perhaps some notes from my travel.

If you want to create a website like this using Blogdown, 
I recommend you to start [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
and [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). 
The first link is a general tutorial on making blog using Bookdown 
and the second one is on how to host it on GitHub.
