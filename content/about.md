My name is Ahmad Alkadri. You can find out more about me 
profesionally on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alkadri). 
Sometimes I travel and took [photos](https://instagram.com/a.alkadri). 

I visited Europe for the first time in 2008, specifically to 
Ukraine, and I fell in love with it. I came back in 2015, 
this time to France, for my Master study. Originally, I came 
from the field of Forestry.
