My name is Ahmad Alkadri. You can find out more about me 
profesionally on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alkadri). 
Sometimes I travel and took [photos](https://instagram.com/a.alkadri). 

I visited Europe for the first time in 2008, specifically to 
Ukraine, and I fell in love with it. I came back in 2015, 
this time to France, for my Master study. Originally, I came 
from the field of Forestry. Due to some weird course of fate, 
I became entangled in the field of wood acoustics, wrote a scientific 
article about violin wood, and now I work as an Applied Researcher 
in the R&D department of [Henri SELMER Paris](https://www.selmer.fr).

Nowadays I work a lot more with R and Python for analyzing data. 
In my spare time I read books, play music, or travel. Also writing, mostly 
for my thesis. I don't know yet what will I do with this blog, but for 
now, I'd like to make it as my little corner in the web.
