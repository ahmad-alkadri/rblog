I'm a Simulation Engineer working for 
[Leko Labs](https://www.lekolabs.com). We're a construction 
company focusing on building wooden houses with lattice-like 
structural system.

This blog is a collection of notes, 
quotes from books that I read, travel journals, 
and--at times--pieces of coding that I've done. 
I made it using Blogdown; a very useful **R** package for 
blogging.

All opinions expressed in this blog are my own; 
I donâ€™t represent anyone else here. If you have any
