I've just read [this article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/use-shortcodes-to-embed-tweets-videos-etc-in-your-blogdown-blog-posts/) 
about embedding YouTube videos using this simple blogdown function:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "P3aGk_Gwqjw")
```

I think I will never cease to be amazed by R developers. 
The possibilities are truly endless now.

***PS:** "Electro swing". Check it out on YouTube. Thank me later.*
