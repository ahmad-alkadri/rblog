<p>A more compatible title perhaps would be:
<strong>How to plot an Excel-like linear regression in R</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a half-note, half-tutorial that I wrote partly because
lately I keep forgetting it, something that I’m actually a bit
ashamed, although it seems to be quite normal.</p>
<p>I suppose a background is needed.</p>
<p>I first started to use R because I’m interested in its
visualization capability. In the lab I was working at the time
(I was an intern then).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = seq(0,10,length.out = 10)
y = seq(0,20,length.out = 10)
plot(x,y)</code></pre>
