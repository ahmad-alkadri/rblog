<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>A more compatible title perhaps would be:
<strong>How to plot an <a href="https://spreadsheeto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trendline-options-line-regression.gif">Excel-like</a> linear regression in R</strong>.
This is a half-note, half-tutorial that I wrote partly because
lately I keep forgetting it, something that I’m actually a bit
ashamed, although it seems apparently to be quite normal among
data scientists to forget some basic things, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/imaad-mohamed-khan-218b3999_datascience-machinelearning-programming-activity-6602948478396129280-YUcV">reading
CSV files</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose a background is needed.</p>
<p>I first started to use R because I’m interested in its
visualization capability. In the lab I was working at the time
(I was an intern then). The large amount of data that I was working
with made it quite difficult to keep using Excel.</p>
<p>That was when I stumbled upon R. A Ph.D. student who
was in the same team with me used it all the time and it just seemed
so seamless for her to use it. So I was interested and started learning.</p>
<p>Among my first tasks was conducting regression analysis <em>and</em>,
afterwards, visualizing them on base R plot. It took me
one full day to learn it and finally save them into a re-usable script.
It involves no additional packages at all but it involves some
specific functions such as <code>lm</code> and knowing <code>bquote</code> syntax.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s get in.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="importing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Importing data</h2>
<p>As an example we’re going to use this insurance price data
from Kaggle that I found, which apparently originated from
this <a href="https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets">repository</a>.
The data contains informations about the people’s age,
BMI, gender, whether they have kids or not, their
region, and whether they smoke or not.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv&quot;)
head(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   age    sex    bmi children smoker    region   charges
## 1  19 female 27.900        0    yes southwest 16884.924
## 2  18   male 33.770        1     no southeast  1725.552
## 3  28   male 33.000        3     no southeast  4449.462
## 4  33   male 22.705        0     no northwest 21984.471
## 5  32   male 28.880        0     no northwest  3866.855
## 6  31 female 25.740        0     no southeast  3756.622</code></pre>
<p>It is clear that the objective of this data is to try to predict the
insurance price based on the parameters available. For starter, let’s
just choose the <code>bmi</code> as the independent variable and of course <code>charges</code>
as the dependent variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>par &lt;- &quot;bmi&quot;
res &lt;- &quot;charges&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And then to facilitates the analysis let’s just save those two parameters
(from the dataframe <code>dat</code>) into two new vectors:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>indvar &lt;- dat[,par]
depvar &lt;- dat[,res]</code></pre>
<p>Now with those data, let’s do the linear regression.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="linear-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear regression</h2>
<p>We’re going to go ahead and assume that the regression with those two
parameters are linear. So, the basic model that we want to have is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = ax+b
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the <code>depvar</code>, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the <code>indvar</code>, while <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the gradient and intercept to be calculated.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reg.lm &lt;- lm(depvar ~ indvar)</code></pre>
<p>and then let’s summarize them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum.reg.lm &lt;- summary(reg.lm)
sum.reg.lm$coefficients</code></pre>
<pre><code>##             Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
## (Intercept) 1192.937 1664.80238 0.7165639 4.737685e-01
## indvar       393.873   53.25074 7.3965741 2.459086e-13</code></pre>
<p>Some things could be noted here, mostly the fact that the
intercept (<em>b</em>) has no significant effect on the model <em>while</em>
the (<em>a</em>) seems to be significant. <strong>Or is it?</strong> We’re going
to verify it soon. For now, let’s save those variables into:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a.lm &lt;- sum.reg.lm$coefficients[1,2]
b.lm &lt;- sum.reg.lm$coefficients[1,1]</code></pre>
<p>and it’s never a bad idea to also save the R-square value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r.lm &lt;- sum.reg.lm$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>and that’s it. We now continue with the visualization.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="plotting" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting</h2>
<p>The first step, the plotting itself, is quite simple.
We just firstly need to put the data into plot
and then make the regression lines:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make the plot
plot(x = indvar, y = depvar,
     xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;,
     pch = 16,
     cex = 0.5)
# Make the regression line
abline(reg.lm, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-11-24-how-to-plot-a-linear-regression-and-display-the-equations-and-r-squared-in-the-same-graph_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Next step is putting the equation on the graph. We have two option:
putting them inside the graph or outside the graph.
Here because we see that the data points are filling the inside
of the graph, putting the equation outside seems a better choice.</p>
<p>Now we make the equation by using <code>bquote</code>, but we to facilitates
the presentation, let’s just make sure that our <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> values
don’t have too many decimals behind. We do this by rounding
them up:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>afin &lt;- round(a.lm, digits = 2)
bfin &lt;- round(b.lm, digits = 2)
rfin &lt;- round(r.lm, digits = 2)</code></pre>
<p>and then we save them into this equation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>eqreg &lt;- bquote(y == .(afin)*x*&quot;+&quot;*.(bfin)*&quot;,&quot;~R^2 == .(rfin))</code></pre>
<p>Now the last thing we should do is to recall the plot
and put the saved equation, <code>eqreg</code>, to the top of the graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make the plot
plot(x = indvar, y = depvar,
     xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;,
     pch = 16,
     cex = 0.5)
# Make the regression line
abline(reg.lm, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2)
mtext(eqreg, side = 3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-11-24-how-to-plot-a-linear-regression-and-display-the-equations-and-r-squared-in-the-same-graph_files/figure-html/plot2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And that’s it! It’s finished.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="final-note" class="section level2">
<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>As a final note, perhaps, we can see clearly that the regression linear
shows that the parameter that we have picked–<code>bmi</code>–definitely does
not have significant relationship with the <code>charges</code>, and thus
can’t be used to predict the insurance price reliable.</p>
<p><em>But what about the other parameters?</em> Well, now that we have the
scripts, we just need to check it out, don’t we? <em>What about
the multivariate regression?</em> Now that’s interesting and definitely
another thing that I need to memorise enough well also. Perhaps later
we will try it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
