<p>After many months considering it,
and even started it but chickened
because of the seeming complexities of it,
I finally got around to putting this simple blog together.</p>
<p>This site is powered by Hugo and edited completely in
Rstudio. I still marvel at <strong>R</strong> these days.
Doing statistics is one thing,
<a href="https://github.com/ahmad-alkadri/Rdiffsolver">finite difference</a> is another,
but making a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">package</a>
so that people can blog using <strong>R</strong>?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll continue writing here, mostly small notes, quotes,
and some codes. See ya!</p>
