To say that a lot of things have changed these past few months 
would be quite an understatement. For me, personally, it's 
been quite difficult, challenging, and for sure, many other changes 
would happen in the coming weeks. What I can say for now is these:

+ my contract with Henri SELMER Paris has ended
+ I've gotten myself a new, permanent contract with another company
+ will update you more about it in the coming weeks, but for now I can say, quite comfortably, that--*boy*--I made a good choice to learn Python and Cast3m.

That's it. Finally, please enjoy this ridiculuously cool 
advert that just popped up on my Instagram's feed:
