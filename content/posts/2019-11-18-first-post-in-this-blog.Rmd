After many months considering it, 
and even started it but chickened 
because of the seeming complexities of it, 
I finally got around to putting this simple blog together.

This site is powered by Hugo and edited completely in 
Rstudio. I still marvel at **R** these days. 
Doing statistics is one thing, 
[finite difference](https://github.com/ahmad-alkadri/Rdiffsolver) is another, 
but making a [package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
so that people can blog using **R**?

I'll continue writing here, mostly small notes, quotes, 
and some codes. See ya!
