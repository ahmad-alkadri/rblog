A more compatible title perhaps would be: 
**How to plot an Excel-like linear regression in R**. 

This is a half-note, half-tutorial that I wrote partly because 
lately I keep forgetting it, something that I'm actually a bit 
ashamed, although it seems to be quite normal.

I suppose a background is needed.

I first started to use R because I'm interested in its 
visualization capability. In the lab I was working at the time 
(I was an intern then).

```{r}
x = seq(0,10,length.out = 10)
y = seq(0,20,length.out = 10)
plot(x,y)
```
