## Intro

Collecting data is undoubtedly one of the most important parts in any data science workflow. 
One of the best easiest ways to collect data, especially from people, is through survey. 
And among the survey-making platforms, Google Forms is particular because it is free, its 
ease of use, and overall very direct. It is perhaps not the best, or with the most feature, but 
it gets the jobs done.

So here I've decided to make this post, a half-note also for me (in case I ever forget, because 
sometimes God forbids me remembering some small but actually very important details). So here is 
a quick tutorial on how to download the survey responses from Google Forms as CSV file:

## Tuto

**1. Go to your Google Drive account and click on the form that you want**
